                            and Southern Africa Health Community (ECSA-HC) is an
                            inter-governmental health organization that fosters
                            and promotes regional cooperation in health among
                            member states. Member states of the ECSA Health
                            Community are Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius,

                        <p> ECSA-HC was established in 1974 to foster and
                            strengthen regional cooperation and capacity to
                            address the health needs of the member states.
                            Through partnerships with diverse institutions,
                            ECSAâ€™s activities also spread to other countries in
                            Africa to address common health challenges facing
                            the region. Within our projects, ECSA supports
                            non-member states including Botswana, Burundi,

                            partners to raise the standard of health for the
                            people of the ECSA region by promoting efficiency
                            and effectiveness of health services through
